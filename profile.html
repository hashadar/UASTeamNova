        <h3>University</h3>
        <p>I am in my second year of Mechanical Engineering MEng at University College London. This course is highly
          engaging with a good balance between practical and theory. As part of my First Year Capstone Assessment, I
          produced a case study on a wind turbine, looking at the materials, power generation, gearbox
          design in a variety of contexts. The full report may be viewed <a
            href="resources/YearOneCapstoneAssessment.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h3>University Societies</h3>
          <p>I am actively involved in a number of societies at University. For second year, I decided to run for
            committee positions at three societies. Currently, I am the President of <a href="https://uclphotosoc.com"
              target="blank">UCL Photo Society</a>, Publicity
            Officer
            for <a href="https://uclstagecrew.wixsite.com/home" target="blank">UCL Stage Crew</a> and part of the Events
            Team at <a href="https://uclengsoc.com" target="blank">UCL Engineering Society</a>.</p>
          <p>At <a href="https://uclphotosoc.com" target="blank">UCL Photo Society</a>, my primary goal is to continue
            the excellent and engaging activities in a safe
            manner.
            Due to the ongoing pandemic, in-person events must be kept to a minimum. Hence, a lot of events will need to
            take place online. My committee and I have continued the society activities with brand new event formats,
            competitions, workshops, socials and more.</p>
          <p>I have taken part in a number of shows whilst at <a href="https://uclstagecrew.wixsite.com/home"
              target="blank">UCL Stage Crew</a>; which can be seen below. Primarily, I work
            in production management and sound design. These technical skills are complimented by strong teamwork, time
            management and hard work. Working in theatre is a great experience as you get to interact with actors,
            musicians, directors and producers and technicians.</p>

              <h5>Production Manager</h5>: A Conspiracy of Sorts by UCL Comedy Club (24th - 26th
              October)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Assistant Sound Designer</h5>: Rhapsody 2020 by UCL Live Music Society (30th January - 1st February)

          <p>As part of the Events team at <a href="https://uclengsoc.com" target="blank">UCL Engineering Society</a>,
            my primary role is to manage and ensure the smooth
            delivery of webinars and workshops with specialists from industry. Teamwork and communication must be
            employed effectively to liaise with Marketing and President/Vice-President, so that our events provide the
            best experience possible to our audience. Some of the things that my role entails are: industry research,
            reaching out to potential speakers, creating presentations, managing webinars and QnAs and more.</p>

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>As part of my degree, we are taught to use a variety of engineering software. I use CATIA V5 and Autodesk
          Fusion 360 for CAD. CATIA V5 is a very powerful piece of software, which is employed in a variety of
          industries. Autodesk Fusion 360 is also a very interesting piece of software, with functionality such as
          generative design and stress/strain modelling. I have used both pieces of software for coursework and personal
          projects alike, most recently designing a line launcher in CATIA V5 as part of the First Year Scenarios 1
          project.</p>
        <p>I also use MATLAB to create computer models with data. However, I have also been learning C++ as a hobby and
          building mini projects with the language. C++ is a powerful language which is also used in micro-controllers
          such as Arduinos, Drone Piloting computers and vehicle ECUs.</p>
        <p>I use LaTeX to write my technical reports and notes. A powerful piece of typesetting software, LaTeX has
          proved to be a powerful tool in creating professional looking documents.</p>
